# Web Audio and Midi Synthesizer
## Experiments

This is a basic subtract style synthesizer built with web audio and midi APIs.
It was done quickly and was meant to be for experimentation and exploration of the APIs.
The code is the best. It isn't very clean, but plugin in a usb midi keyboard and it's fun to play with.

### Features
- Midi controlled
- 3 Oscillators (selectable waves:  square, triangle, sawtooth)
- Oscillator 3 acts more like a sub oscillator (1 octave lower than the other 2 osscillators)
- Detune button
- 1 LowPass Filter with Cutoff and Resonance (Q)
